    "description": "AWS Support The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need\ndetailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. This\nservice enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses\nHTTP methods that return results in JSON format.\n\nThe AWS Support service also exposes a set of Trusted Advisor\n[http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/] features. You can\nretrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify\nchecks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks. \n\nThe following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:\n\n *   Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels. The \n   DescribeServices and DescribeSeverityLevels operations return AWS service\n   names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels. You\n   use these values when you call the CreateCase operation. \n   \n   \n *   Case creation, case details, and case resolution. The CreateCase, \n   DescribeCases, DescribeAttachment, and ResolveCase operations create AWS\n   Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases.\n   \n   \n *   Case communication. The DescribeCommunications, AddCommunicationToCase, and \n   AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve and add communications and\n   attachments to AWS Support cases. \n   \n   \n\nThe following list describes the operations available from the AWS Support\nservice for Trusted Advisor:\n\n *   DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the list of checks that run against\n   your AWS resources.\n   \n   \n *  Using the checkId for a specific check returned by \n   DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks, you can call DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult \n   to obtain the results for the check you specified.\n   \n   \n *   DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries returns summarized results for one or\n   more Trusted Advisor checks.\n   \n   \n *   RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified\n   check. \n   \n   \n *   DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh status of one\n   or more checks. \n   \n   \n\nFor authentication of requests, AWS Support uses Signature Version 4 Signing\nProcess [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html].\n\nSee About the AWS Support API\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html] in the AWS\nSupport User Guide for information about how to use this service to create and\nmanage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks\non your resources.",
